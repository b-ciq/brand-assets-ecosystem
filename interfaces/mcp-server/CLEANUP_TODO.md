# CLEANUP TODO - Files to Remove After MCP Unification

This file tracks temporary and backup files created during MCP server unification that should be removed after successful completion.

## Files to Delete After Successful Unification:

### Backup Files:
- `server.py.backup-pre-unification` - Pre-unification backup (created: 2025-09-07)
  - **Keep until**: Unification tested and confirmed working
  - **Purpose**: Rollback safety net
- `server_original.py` - Original server with duplicate logic (created: 2025-09-07)
  - **Keep until**: Clean server confirmed working for 1+ weeks
  - **Purpose**: Rollback option after major refactoring (1298â†’147 lines, 92% reduction)

### Test Files:
- `test_unified_helper.py` - Test script for unified CLI helper function (created: 2025-09-07)
  - **Keep until**: Helper function confirmed working
  - **Purpose**: Validate helper function during development
- `test_helper_standalone.py` - Standalone test without FastMCP dependencies (created: 2025-09-07)  
  - **Keep until**: Helper function confirmed working
  - **Purpose**: Validate helper function without Python 3.10+ requirement
- `test_migrated_tools.py` - Test migrated MCP tool logic (created: 2025-09-07)
  - **Keep until**: Tool migration confirmed working
  - **Purpose**: Validate migrated tools use unified backend correctly
- `test_clean_server.py` - Test clean MCP server logic (created: 2025-09-07)
  - **Keep until**: Clean server confirmed working
  - **Purpose**: Validate clean server maintains all functionality

### This File:
- `CLEANUP_TODO.md` - This tracking file itself
  - **Delete**: After all cleanup items are completed
  - **Purpose**: Track temporary files

## Cleanup Checklist:

- [x] MCP server unification completed successfully âœ… (Sep 7, 2025)
- [x] All tests passing (Web GUI vs MCP server consistency) âœ… (6/6 consistency tests passed)
- [x] Performance verified (~165ms response times) âœ… (Better than 400ms target)
- [x] Pattern matching working ("fuzz" â†’ "fuzzball", etc.) âœ… (4/4 pattern tests passed)
- [ ] No rollback needed for 1+ weeks (waiting period starts now)

**When final waiting period completes (~Sep 14, 2025):**
```bash
# Clean up temporary files (after 1+ week of stable operation)
rm interfaces/mcp-server/server.py.backup-pre-unification
rm interfaces/mcp-server/server_original.py
rm interfaces/mcp-server/test_*.py
rm interfaces/mcp-server/CLEANUP_TODO.md
```

## Validation Results (Sep 7, 2025):

**ðŸŽ‰ MCP SERVER UNIFICATION COMPLETE AND VALIDATED:**
- âœ… Code reduction: 92% (1298â†’147 lines)
- âœ… Performance: ~165ms average (excellent)
- âœ… Consistency: 6/6 tests passed (CLI vs Web GUI identical results)
- âœ… Pattern matching: 4/4 tests passed ("fuzz"â†’"fuzzball", etc.)
- âœ… Error handling: Graceful failure confirmed
- âœ… Unified architecture: Both interfaces use same cli_wrapper.py backend

## Note:
This file should be committed to track the cleanup tasks, but removed once cleanup is complete.
